### Setup
1. Run the command `npm install`. That should install all the dependencies.
2. Create an auth.json file in the same directory as main.js. Below you can find an example.
3. If you haven't already, setup a rethink database.
4. Once all that is done run the command `npm start`

#### auth.json
```json
{
  "token":"BOT TOKEN",
  "db":{
    "host": "Your rethinkdb host ip",
    "user":"Your rethinkdb user",
    "password":"Your rethinkdb user password"
   } 
}
```
